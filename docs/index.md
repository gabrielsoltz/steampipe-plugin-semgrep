# Semgrep + Steampipe

[Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) is a Fast, customizable, and developer-oriented SAST. Scan 30+ languages with 2,750+ Community and Pro rules.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

Query your security findings and filter by state:

```sql
select
  id,
  state,
  rule_message
from
  semgrep_findings
where
  deployment_slug = 'my-company' and
  state = 'unresolved';
```

```
