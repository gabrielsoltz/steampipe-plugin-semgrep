# Table: semgrep_finding

A Semgrep finding is a detailed report or notification generated by the Semgrep static code analysis tool when it detects a problem or anomaly within the source code of a software application. These findings typically include information about the location of the issue within the codebase, a description of the problem, and often a severity rating to help prioritize and address the identified concern.

## Examples

### List all Semgrep findings

```sql
select
   id,
   state,
   repository,
   triage_state,
   severity,
   confidence,
   rule_name
from
   semgrep_finding
where
   deployment_slug = 'my-deployment';
```

### List all Semgrep findings with high severity that are not triaged

```sql
select
   id,
   state,
   repository,
   triage_state,
   severity,
   confidence,
   rule_name
from
   semgrep_finding
where
   deployment_slug = 'my-deployment'
   and severity = 'high'
   and triage_state = 'untriaged';
```
